retroSnake
==========

PyGame meets vector graphics meets poor API design.

The retroSnake.py file is the actual library code.

The main.py file is currently a small test case showcasing two sprites,
a line and a box that can be controlled independantly with the arrow
keys and WASD respectively.

It is my hope that with a little work this library could be used to
implement some retro-style games such as space invaders or asteroids
without having to rely upon bitmapped sprites.
